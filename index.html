        <h2>Swarm Cluster Information</h2>
        <p>
            I have created my own Swarm cluster with 3 master nodes and 2 worker nodes.
            This cluster is designed for high availability, fault tolerance, and supports multiple replicas.

        <h2>Website Deployment on Swarm Cluster</h2>
        <p>
            I have built my own image for this website and deployed it on the Swarm cluster.
            The deployment is achieved through the creation of a service.
            Clients can access the website via the Swarm cluster.
