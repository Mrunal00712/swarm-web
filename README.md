Project Idea: Creating a Swarm-Cluster of High availability and deploying the website.

Deployment to Swarm Cluster:
✔ Leveraging Docker Swarm for orchestration.
✔ Deploying the website as a service within the Swarm cluster.

Swarm Cluster Configuration:
✔ Nodes: 3 master nodes and 3 worker nodes.
✔ Network: Connected via an overlay network for seamless communication.

Cluster Features:
✔ High Availability: Ensuring the website remains accessible even in the face of node failures.
✔ Fault Tolerance: Minimizing downtime and maintaining service availability.
✔ Replication: Supporting multiple replicas for scalability.

Workflow Overview:
✔ Develop the website content and design.
✔ Create a Dockerfile for packaging the web application.
✔ Build a custom Docker image and push it to the Docker Global Registry.
✔ Deploy the image as a service in the Swarm cluster.

Benefits:
✔ Efficient management of containers.
✔ Seamless scalability with Swarm orchestration.
✔ Robust high-availability architecture.
